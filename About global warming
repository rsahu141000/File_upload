Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperature has increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 1850—the year that accurate recordkeeping began—and 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees Celsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) every 10 years. Since 1981, however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For the last 40 years, we’ve seen the global annual temperature rise by 0.2 degrees Celsius, or 0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade.

The result? A planet that has never been hotter. The 10 most recent years are the warmest years on record. And the warmer it gets, the more probable it becomes that we trigger climate tipping points (such as rapid glacier melt or thawing permafrost) that can transform natural systems into entirely different states and lead to more warming. 

In 2015, the Paris Agreement codified the recommendation of climate scientists to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Working toward that goal continues to give us our best chance to stave off the worst, most devastating effects of climate change: the extreme droughts, wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and other disasters that are so widespread and costly to both our infrastructure and our health.
